This weather app was created so I could practice importing API'S using Django. Using HTML, Bootstrap/CSS, and Django i was able to complete this project.
The API used in this project is from https://openweathermap.org/api. Which is a website that tracks current weather conditions from most places in the world.

COMING SOON: www.gagelieble.com/weather

HOW TO RUN LOCALLY:

DJANGO: You must be in the file directory that contains 'manage.py' inorder to run this project locally. The 'weather_proj', 'weather_app', 'templates', and 'static' files must also be present in this directory. After installing django on your machine you can enter the following into your terminal.

- WINDOWS: py -m manage runserver
- MAC: manage.py runserver
- Shift click on 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/' in your terminal
- This will open a tab in your default broswer with this project!
